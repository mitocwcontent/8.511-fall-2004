description: 'In this lecture the Bravais lattice is defined and several examples
  given. The basis vector is introduced for a general lattice. The theory of diffraction
  is derived, showing that Bragg refraction occurs when the momentum transfer equals
  a reciprocal vector. The reciprocal lattice is

  defined.The Ewald construction for X ?ray diffraction is explained. Emphasis is
  on the fact that the position of the diffraction spots depends only on the Bravais
  lattice. The basis only affects their intensities.'
